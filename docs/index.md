## Overview
VQE Optimization provides modular Hamiltonian builders and command-line runners for Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
workflows. The current implementation focuses on the Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) and a molecular Hamiltonian
(H2O) using Qiskit primitives, with optional IQM backend support.

## Project Scope
- Hamiltonian registry with typed specifications and validation.
- TFIM Hamiltonian construction with open or periodic boundary conditions.
- Molecular Hamiltonian construction for H2O with active-space reduction and optional tapering.
- CLI runners for single VQE simulations, benchmarks, and TFIM scans.
